What have I done?

1. Integrated a concurrency library to retrieve information for each Pokemon faster.
2. Implemented simple caching to prevent overloading caused by frequent requests.
3. Achieved full coverage with unit tests.
4. Used the best practice recommended by Joshua Bloch (see PokemonTopType)

What would I do?

1. Implement an Open API specification for the project.
2. Implement security measures to protect the application.
3. Configure Jacoco for code coverage reporting.
4. Build CI/CD pipeline for application containerization, running tests and deploying to AWS
5. Use more sophisticated cache mechanism
6. Conduct integration testing to ensure the components of the system work together correctly.
